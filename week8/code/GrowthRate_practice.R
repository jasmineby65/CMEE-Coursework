#### Population growth rates ####

# A population grows exponentially while its abundance is low and resources are not limiting (the Malthusian principle). 
# This growth then slows and eventually stops as resources become limiting. 
# There may also be a time lag before the population growth really takes off at the start. 

# We will focus on microbial (specifically, bacterial) growth rates. 
# Bacterial growth in batch culture follows a distinct set of phases; lag phase, exponential phase and stationary phase. 
# During the lag phase a suite of transcriptional machinery is activated, including genes involved in nutrient uptake and 
# metabolic changes, as bacteria prepare for growth. During the exponential growth phase, bacteria divide at a constant rate, 
# the population doubling with each generation. When the carrying capacity of the media is reached, growth slows and the number 
# of cells in the culture stabilizes, beginning the stationary phase.

# Traditionally, microbial growth rates were measured by plotting cell numbers or culture density against time on a semi-log graph 
# and fitting a straight line through the exponential growth phase â€“ the slope of the line gives the maximum growth rate (r_max)
# Models have since been developed which we can use to describe the whole sigmoidal bacterial growth curve
