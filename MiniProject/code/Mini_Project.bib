abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {1. Most models of growth are simply mathematical descriptions of growth trajectories. They are evaluated empirically based on goodness of statistical fit. 2. Recently we (West et al. 2001) presented a theory of growth based on first principles of energy conservation and allocation. The critical parameters are defined precisely and operationally in terms of measurable fundamental parameters not directly connected to growth, so the mechanistic basis of the model can be evaluated by testing both the assumptions and the predictions. To the extent that available data permit such evaluation, they generally support the model for many classes of organisms including mammals, birds, fish and crustacea. 3. Our model provides a basis for understanding the general and fundamental features governing ontogenetic growth. It is intended to explain the major patterns in terms of first principles of energy allocation to production (of new cells) and maintenance (of existing cells) that are applicable to all organisms. While the model is not intended to account for all of the observed variation in growth rates and life histories it does provide a baseline for developing more detailed treatments of ontogenetic growth. 4. Ricklefs (2003) has criticized the conceptual foundation of our theory as it applies to birds and asserts that it cannot account for many of their growth and life-history attributes. 5. He correctly points to similarities in mathematical form and statistical fit between our growth model and that of von Bertalanffy 1938, but fails to point out the fundamental conceptual differences between the two models. 6. With respect to birds, our model suggests a new hypothesis based on water balance, for the difference in growth allometry between altricial and precocial species. In particular we show that ours is the only model discussed by Ricklefs that correctly predicts the absolute value and scaling characteristics of the total energy metabolized by altricial birds from hatching to fledging. 7. In contrast, Ricklefs's models are of limited utility since they are primarily designed for birds, and are based on qualitative concepts such as 'growth potential' and 'functionality' of tissues and therefore do not readily lead to quantitative predictions. 8. Our model does not imply that mature or asymptotic size is determined simply by resource supply. It allows for a mature body size that is set by natural selection and that results in a balance of energy allocation between production of new biomass and maintenance of existing biomass.},

To achieve these goals, it is essential to foster the development of what we call efficient theories, which have several key attributes. Efficient theories are grounded in first principles, are usually expressed in the language of mathematics, make few assumptions and generate a large number of predictions per free parameter, are approximate, and entail predictions that provide well-understood standards for comparison with empirical data.

abstract = {Empirical and phenomenological-based models are used to represent biological and physiological processes. Phenomenological models are derived from the knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie the behavior of the system under study, while empirical models are derived from data analysis to quantify relationships between variables of interest. For studying biological systems, the phenomenological modeling approach offers the great advantage of having a structure with variables and parameters with physical meaning that enhance the interpretability of the model and its further use for decision making. The interpretability property of models, however, remains a vague concept. In this study, we addressed the interpretability property for parameters of phenomenological-based models. To our knowledge, this property has not been deeply discussed, perhaps by the implicit assumption that interpretability is inherent to phenomenological-based models. We propose a conceptual framework to address parameter interpretability and its implications for parameter identifiability, using a simple but relevant model representing the enzymatic degradation of $\beta$−casein by a Lactococcus lactis bacterium. We illustrated the usefulness of integrating parameter interpretability in the process of construction and exploitation of phenomenological models.},

abstract = {The use of primary mathematical models with curve fitting software is dramatically changing quantitative food microbiology. The two most widely used primary growth models are the Baranyi and Gompertz models. A three-phase linear model was developed to determine how well growth curves could be described using a simpler model. The model divides bacterial growth curves into three phases: the lag and stationary phases where the specific growth rate is zero ($\mu$=0), and the exponential phase where the logarithm of the bacterial population increases linearly with time (p=constant). The model has four parameters: N(o) (Log10 of initial population density), NMAX (Log10 of final population density), tLAG (time when lag phase ends), and tMAX (time when exponential phase ends). A comparison of the linear model was made against the Baranyi and Gompertz models, using established growth data for Escherichia coli 0157:H7. The growth curves predicted by the three models showed good agreement. The linear model was more 'robust' than the others, especially when experimental data were minimal. The physiological assumptions underlying the linear model are discussed, with particular emphasis on assuring that the model is consistent with bacterial behavior both as individual cells and as populations. It is proposed that the transitional behavior of bacteria at the end of the lag phase can be explained on the basis of biological variability.},

abstract = {This study investigated the characteristics of spoilage bacteria isolated from fresh produce including growth at various temperatures, biofilm formation, cell hydrophobicity, and colony spreading. The number of spoilage bacteria present when stored at 35 °C was significantly greater than when stored at lower temperatures, and maximum population size was achieved after 10 h. However, Bacillus pumilus, Dickeya zeae, Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. Carotovorum Pcc21, and Bacillus pumilus (RDA-R) did not grow at the storage temperature of 5 °C. The biofilm formation by Clavibacter michiganensis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and A. calcoaceticus (RDA-R) are higher than other spoilage bacteria. Biofilm formation showed low correlation between hydrophobicity, and no significant correlation with colony spreading. These results might be used for developing safe storage guidelines for fresh produce at various storage temperatures, and could be basic information on the growth characteristics and biofilm formation properties of spoilage bacteria from fresh produce. Practical Application: Growth of spoilage bacteria was different depending on the bacteria strains and storage temperature. Between biofilm formation and cell hydrophobicity was low correlation on spoilage bacteria. Therefore, growth characteristics and biofilm formation of spoilage bacteria might be used for developing safe storage guidelines for fresh produce at various storage temperatures.},

@article{Jones2018,
abstract = {When a substitution model is fitted to an alignment using maximum likelihood, its parameters are adjusted to account for as much site-pattern variation as possible. A parameter might therefore absorb a substantial quantity of the total variance in an alignment (or more formally, bring about a substantial reduction in the deviance of the fitted model) even if the process it represents played no role in the generation of the data. When this occurs, we say that the parameter estimate carries phenomenological load (PL). Large PL in a parameter estimate is a concern because it not only invalidates its mechanistic interpretation (if it has one) but also increases the likelihood that it will be found to be statistically significant. The problem of PL was not identified in the past because most off-the-shelf substitution models make simplifying assumptions that preclude the generation of realistic levels of variation. In this study, we use the more realistic mutation-selection framework as the basis of a generating model formulated to produce data that mimic an alignment of mammalian mitochondrial DNA. We show that a parameter estimate can carry PL when 1) the substitution model is underspecified and 2) the parameter represents a process that is confounded with other processes represented in the data-generating model. We then provide a method that can be used to identify signal for the process that a given parameter represents despite the existence of PL.},

The fit of our model to growth data was indistinguishable from that of the well-known models of P{\"{u}}tter [3], von Bertallanfy [4,5], and the ontogenetic growth model (OGM) proposed by West and colleagues [6,7].

abstract = {The inherent complexity of biological systems gives rise to complicated mechanistic models with a large number of parameters. On the other hand, the collective behavior of these systems can often be characterized by a relatively small number of phenomenological parameters. We use the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM) as a tool for deriving simple phenomenological models from complicated mechanistic models. The resulting models are not black boxes, but remain expressed in terms of the microscopic parameters. In this way, we explicitly connect the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions, characterize the equivalence class of distinct systems exhibiting the same range of collective behavior, and identify the combinations of components that function as tunable control knobs for the behavior. We demonstrate the procedure for adaptation behavior exhibited by the EGFR pathway. From a 48 parameter mechanistic model, the system can be effectively described by a single adaptation parameter $\tau$ characterizing the ratio of time scales for the initial response and recovery time of the system which can in turn be expressed as a combination of microscopic reaction rates, Michaelis-Menten constants, and biochemical concentrations. The situation is not unlike modeling in physics in which microscopically complex processes can often be renormalized into simple phenomenological models with only a few effective parameters. The proposed method additionally provides a mechanistic explanation for non-universal features of the behavior.},

abstract = {Dynamics of complex systems is often driven by large and intricate networks of microscopic interactions, whose sheer size obfuscates understanding. With limited experimental data, many parameters of such dynamics are unknown, and thus detailed, mechanistic models risk overfitting and making faulty predictions. At the other extreme, simple ad hoc models often miss defining features of the underlying systems. Here we develop an approach that instead constructs phenomenological, coarse-grained models of network dynamics that automatically adapt their complexity to the available data. Such adaptive models produce accurate predictions even when microscopic details are unknown. The approach is computationally tractable, even for a relatively large number of dynamical variables. Using simulated data, it correctly infers the phase space structure for planetary motion, avoids overfitting in a biological signalling system and produces accurate predictions for yeast glycolysis with tens of data points and over half of the interacting species unobserved. Mechanistic modelling of dynamical phenomena with many degrees of freedom runs the risk of overfitting and making faulty predictions, whereas ad hocmodels may miss defining features. Here the authors develop an approach to construct dynamical models that adapt their complexity to the amount of available data.},

abstract = {The identifiability properties of the Baranyi model for bacterial growth were investigated, both structurally and applied to real-life data. Using the Taylor-series approach, it was formally proven that the model is structurally identifiable, i.e. it is now ascertained that it is certainly possible to give unique values to all parameters of the model, provided the bacterial growth data are of sufficiently good quality. The model also has acceptable practical identifiability properties in the presence of realistic data, which means that the confidence intervals on the parameter values are reasonable. However, there was a relatively high correlation between the maximum specific growth rate $\mu$(max) and the suitability indicator h(o). An optimal experimental design to improve parameter estimation uncertainty was worked out, using the sampling times of the microbial growth curve as experimental degree of freedom. Using a D-optimal design criterion, it could be shown that the optimal sampling times were concentrated in four time periods (initial, start and end of exponential growth, end of experiment), each providing maximum information on a particular parameter. Because the optimal experimental design requires a priori estimates of the parameters, the propagation of the parameter uncertainty into the experimental design was assessed with a Monte Carlo simulation. In this way, 95{\%} confidence intervals could be established around the optimal sampling times to be used in the optimal experiment. Based on these intervals, a design was proposed and experimentally validated. The error on the parameter estimates was more than halved, their correlation diminished and the nonlinearity of the result improved.},

abstract = {Three of the most fundamental questions in biology are how individual cells differentiate to form tissues, how tissues function in a coordinated and flexible fashion and which gene regulatory mechanisms support these processes. Single-cell genomics is opening up new ways to tackle these questions by combining the comprehensive nature of genomics with the microscopic resolution that is required to describe complex multicellular systems. Initial single-cell genomic studies provided a remarkably rich phenomenology of heterogeneous cellular states, but transforming observational studies into models of dynamics and causal mechanisms in tissues poses fresh challenges and requires stronger integration of theoretical, computational and experimental frameworks.},
