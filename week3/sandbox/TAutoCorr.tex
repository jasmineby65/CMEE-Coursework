  \section*{Introduction}
  The annual temperature dataset from Key West in Florida, USA for the 20th century is analysed to examine whether there is a significant correlation between annual temperatures of successive years.
  
  
  \section*{Results}
    Permutation analysis gave a p-value of 0.0004, with four of the permutated correlation coefficients (number of permutation = 10,000) exceeding the correlation coefficient of the original data ($r = 0.326$).
Therefore, the temperature change across the years in Florida is not random.
